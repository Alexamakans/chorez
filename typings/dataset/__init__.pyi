    """Opens a new connection to a database.

    *url* can be any valid `SQLAlchemy engine URL`_.  If *url* is not defined
    it will try to use *DATABASE_URL* from environment variable.  Returns an
    instance of :py:class:`Database <dataset.Database>`. Additionally,
    *engine_kwargs* will be directly passed to SQLAlchemy, e.g. set
    *engine_kwargs={'pool_recycle': 3600}* will avoid `DB connection timeout`_.
    Set *row_type* to an alternate dict-like class to change the type of
    container rows are stored in.::

        db = dataset.connect('sqlite:///factbook.db')

    One of the main features of `dataset` is to automatically create tables and
    columns as data is inserted. This behaviour can optionally be disabled via
    the `ensure_schema` argument. It can also be overridden in a lot of the
    data manipulation methods using the `ensure` flag.

    If you want to run custom SQLite pragmas on database connect, you can add them
    to on_connect_statements as a set of strings. You can view a full
    `list of PRAGMAs here`_.
